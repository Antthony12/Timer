Lap timer script for any track.

Context
A week ago, I was looking for a mod or script to automatically time fast laps. The best one I found was Race Timer (https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/race-timer), but it's broken... so I had no choice but to create my own script.

I tried to compile it but couldn't.

Requirements
Script Hook V (https://dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/)
ScriptHookVDotNet (https://github.com/scripthookvdotnet/scripthookvdotnet-nightly/releases)

Installation
1. Extract timer.dll and timer.ini, one of the 2 languages, into your scripts folder.
2. Modify the timer.ini file:
	- Paths: Modify the paths of the .txt files in which the laps and telemetry will be saved.
	- Settings: Modifies settings related to the script.
		- ShowTelemetry: When starting a lap, the vehicle's telemetry is displayed above the elapsed time. If false, it is hidden.
		- ShowElapsedTime: When starting a lap, the elapsed time is displayed at the bottom center of the screen. If false, it is hidden.
		- SaveTelemetry: If true, when starting a lap, 4 records of telemetry per second will be written to the TelemetryFile. It is recommended to keep it set to 				 false for as long as possible for the sake of computer storage. It is independent of ShowTelemetry.
		- SpeedUnit: Choose the speed measurement unit in which you want to display and save the telemetry.
		- SelectedTrack: Select the track you are going to do laps on.
		- Tolerance: Defines the size of the finish line and sectors. Keep in mind that it is not a line, but a circle like the checkpoints in the base game. Do 			     not set it to f as in previous versions.
		- TelemetryColors: Choose the colors of the telemetry elements.
		- Circuits: By default, there are mods for real circuits loaded, but you can easily add/delete as many as you want. To delete, delete the circuit line and 			    that's it. To add a circuit, in a new line follow this template:

			    Circuit_Name = coordinatesX,coordinatesY,coordinatesZ/coordinatesX,coordinatesY,coordinatesZ/coordinatesX,coordinatesY,coordinatesZ

			    Each trio of coordinates is a checkpoint, the first being the start and the last being the finish (which have to be the same as the start to 			    start and finish the lap in the same place). At least put 3 points because with 1 and 2 the lap will start and end instantly, in the next 				    version it will be possible. Do not put f as in previous versions.
3. Save the file, very important.

Once the game is started and you want to modify something in the .ini file, after modifying and saving reload the scripts to apply the changes. Reloading will also switch to a "session", laps and times will be reset.

Usage
To start timing laps, cross the start/finish line of the circuit, which corresponds to the first trio of coordinates. As you cross, a notification will appear indicating that the lap has started, and the elapsed time and telemetry will be displayed as subtitles, if enabled of course.

As you pass through the sectors, another notification will appear indicating the sector, the sector time and the delta to the best lap with the same car in the same session.

When you cross the last point, another notification will appear indicating that the lap has ended along with the lap time and delta, and the next lap will start immediately. This will repeat continuously.

To stop the timer and cancel the lap, press the "N" key, and the script will not be activated again until you cross the finish line.

N: Cancel lap.

Conclusion
That's it. It's a basic script, it's the first one I've made for GTA 5, I plan to improve it a bit more, like modifying what's visible in the telemetry and its colors, validating that the coordinates format is correct and... well, I can't think of anything else for now.

If you find a mistake, have an idea or want to help, leave a comment and I'll reply when I see it xddd.
